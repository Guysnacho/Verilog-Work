## Modern Digital System Verilog Projects
This is a collection of the projects I completed in Modern Digital Systems, I had a lot of fun thanks to the professor. A lot of learning despite the transition to an online setting thanks to Covid.

Each project has a at least 1 starter file and 1 running file. The starter is used to test the application we built, we were responsible for making accurate and reliable starter files.
